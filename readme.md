# walkhighlands-rated-sort

Firefox browser extension to sort Walkhighlands walks by ratings.

## Install

Clone this repo locally (or just download the files).

In Firefox, open [about:debugging](about:debugging), click the _This Firefox_ tab (top left), click the _Load Temporary Add-on_ button, then select the `manifest.json` file from this repo. The extension will remain active until Firefox is closed/restarted.

Access [the WalkHighlands search page](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/walk-search.php) and enter your search parameters, then click _Search Now_. If the extension is properly installed, the table of results should have a "Click here to sort by ratings button" at the top, which will sort the table (from best rated to worst) upon being clicked.
